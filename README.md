## About The Project

This was one of the first arcade games I completed with the help of Java and the LibGDX framework! I had a lot of fun learning about simple 2D programming techniques such as sprite batching and render loops. The game can be played against a friend, **(left paddle = WASD, right paddle = Arrow keys)**, or an **AI**. 

There are two difficulties for the AI. **Easy difficulty** allows the AI to make some mistakes or move slowly. **Hard difficulty** provides a very quick and overpowered AI. The only way you can beat this difficult AI is to outlast it as the speed of the ball increases!

### Built With

## Getting Started

The repository comes with three **JAR files**, and three **batch scripts** to run them!

To play the game, simply have a valid installation of a [**Java Runtime Environment (JRE)**](https://www.oracle.com/ca-en/java/technologies/downloads/) and double-click on the batch script that you would like to run! (**multiplayer, easy, or hard**)

**Note**: If you are on Mac/Linux, simply navigate to your cloned repository's location and execute the desired batch script using the terminal. For example:

`java -jar Pong_multiplayer.jar`
